### Purpose

With **83% of developers experiencing burnout** and **51% diagnosed with mental health conditions**, this project aims to:

- Break the stigma surrounding mental health in tech
- Provide accessible, developer-focused mental health information
- Offer practical coping strategies and resources
- Create a supportive, calming digital environment
- Raise awareness about the mental health crisis in our industry

### Planning / Wireframing

As this was for a simple one page website, wireframing was done using basic sketches and notes on a whiteboard. The planning was mainly focused on the macro level, thinking about the main sections and flow of the site rather than detailed UI elements.
